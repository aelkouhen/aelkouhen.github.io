### Amine's Story
With more than 15 years of experience in building and promoting Data/BI platforms, I was involved in the design and the implementation of thousands of Data pipelines and Analytics artifacts (DWH/Datamarts data models) for Financial Reporting, Sales Analysis, Operational KPIs and Cost Allocation Drivers. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Sciences from University of Lille (North of France) and a Certificate of Specialization in Business Strategy from Harvard Business School.
