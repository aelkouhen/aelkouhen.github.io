With more than 15 years of experience building and promoting Data/BI platforms, I designed and implemented thousands of Data pipelines and Analytics artifacts (DWH/Datamarts data models) for Financial Reporting, Sales Analysis, Operational KPIs, and Cost Allocation Drivers. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Sciences from the University of Lille (North of France) and a Certificate of Specialization in Business Strategy from the Harvard Business School (HBS).
