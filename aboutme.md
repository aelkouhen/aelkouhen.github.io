### Amine's Story
With more than 15 years of experience in building and promoting Data/BI platforms, I was involved in the design and the implementation of thousands of Data pipelines and Analytics artifacts (DWH/Datamarts data models) for Financial Reporting, Sales Analysis, Operational KPIs and Cost Allocation Drivers. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Sciences from University of Lille (North of France) and M.Sc. in Information Systems from University of Lorraine (Nancy - France). I'm also certified from Harvard Business School in Business Strategy.
