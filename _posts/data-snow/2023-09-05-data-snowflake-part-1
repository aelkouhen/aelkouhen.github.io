Organizations are experiencing significant data asset growth and leveraging Snowflake to gather data insights to grow their businesses. This data includes structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data coming in batches or streams.

As you’ve seen in previous posts, Data ingestion is the first stage of the data lifecycle. Here, data is collected from various internal sources like databases, CRMs, ERPs, legacy systems, external ones such as surveys, and third-party providers. This is an important step because it ensures the excellent working of subsequent stages in the data lifecycle.

In this stage, raw data are extracted from one or more data sources, replicated, and then ingested into a storage location called stage. Once data is integrated into Snowflake, you can use powerful features such as Snowpark, Data Sharing, and more to derive value from data to send to reporting tools, partners, and customers. 

In this article, I will illustrate data ingestion and integration using Snowflake’s first-party methods to meet the different data pipeline needs, from batch to continuous ingestion. These methods include but are not limited to `INSERT`, `COPY INTO`, `Snowpipe`, `Snowpipe Streaming` or the `Kafka Connector`.
