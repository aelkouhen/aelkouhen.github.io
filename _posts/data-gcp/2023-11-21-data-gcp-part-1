Through the “Data on GCP” series, you will learn how to collect, store, process, analyze, and expose data using a wide variety of tools provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP). GCP, offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that provides a series of modular cloud services including computing, data storage, data analytics and machine learning, alongside a set of management tools.

In this article, I will illustrate data ingestion and integration using the myriad of tools GCP provides. As you’ve seen earlier, Data ingestion is the first stage of the data lifecycle. This is where data is collected from various internal sources like databases, CRM, ERPs, legacy systems, external ones such as surveys, and third-party providers. This is an important step because it ensures the good working of subsequent stages in the data lifecycle.

In this stage, raw data are extracted from one or more data sources, replicated, then ingested into a landing storage support, Storage Services for instance. We’ve seen that most ingestion tools can handle a high volume of data with a wide range of formats (structured, unstructured…), but they differ in how they handle the data velocity. We often distinguish three main categories of data ingestion tools: batch-based, real-time or stream-based, and hybrid ingestion. Within Google Cloud, we will see the different data ingestion services and how they can address the different categories of data ingestion.
