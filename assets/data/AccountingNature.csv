A20600,"Leasehold right","This account records amounts paid by a new lessor to a third party, pursuant to the transfer of a lease or commercial entitlement to business assets. In France, leasehold interests are common practice and can take two forms depending on the third party with which the entity performs the transaction:
- leasehold interest (entry fee) when the new lessee pays an amount agreed with the former lessee in order to sign a leasehold contract and enter the premises.
- key money when the lessee pays an amount agreed with the lessor in order to sign a leasehold contract and enter the premises. 
The accounting method differs between leasehold interests and key money. IFRS accounting treatments:
- leasehold interests are recognised as intangible assets and amortised over the lease term.
- key money is considered additional rent: a prepaid expense is recognised in the amount paid and released to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In certain cases, key money may be considered an indefinite life intangible asset (not amortised but tested for impairment) or a finite life intangible asset (amortised).","Intangible fixed assets - gross amount"
A20700,"Business Assets","This account records the gross value of purchased goodwill (""fonds commercial""), defined as all identifiable intangible assets of a business.

Do not confuse purchased goodwill and business assets. 
1/ Purchased goodwill is defined in law as all tangible and intangible items involved in the set-up and launch of a commercial activity. The identifiable tangible and intangible items of business assets that may be valued separately in the balance sheet are recognised in assets according to their nature, residual items constitute purchased goodwill.
2/ Leasehold interests are a component of purchased goodwill but are often recorded separately (see #20600000) as generally associated with a specific agreement.","Intangible fixed assets - gross amount"

In the year of recognition, this distortion contributes to increasing the taxable accounting income (expense not deductible in Y), while in the future it will generate a tax savings (deduction from taxable income).
Deferred tax assets are amounts of income taxes recoverable in future periods in respect of:
a) deductible temporary differences,
b) the carry forward of unused tax losses (loss carry-forwards), and
c) the carry forward of unused tax credits.
Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base.
N.B.
1/ The tax base of an asset is the amount that will be deductible for tax purposes against any taxable profits when the entity recovers the carrying amount of the asset, either through sale or utilisation.
2/ Whether they are the result of deductible temporary differences or tax losses carried forward, deferred tax assets may only be recognised if their recovery is considered highly probable:
- on reversal, deductible temporary differences will be offset against deferred tax liabilities reversing at the same time, this necessitates the monitoring of the DTA reversal schedule,
- tax losses carried forward will be offset against future taxable profits, this necessitates the preparation and monitoring of a medium/long-term business plan.
Where the recovery of DTA recognised previously is called into question, they must be written-down to the amount of deferred tax liabilities (DTL).","Tax payables and receivables"

- the provision amount to be recognised is the most likely amount payable by the entity,
-  tax risks should be reassessed at each closing while taking into account any changes in facts and circumstances regarding the tax risks during the period (case law, laws or regulations, tax guidance).

Therefore, the entity must:
(a) recognize its reimbursement right as a separate asset and value that asset at its fair value (# 27600000),
(b) to break down and recognize changes in the fair value of its right to repayment in the same way as changes in the fair value of plan assets: actuarial gains and losses arising in the benefit period subsequent to the employment are recognized in OCI and the implicit return on the right to reimbursement is recognized in the financial result.
